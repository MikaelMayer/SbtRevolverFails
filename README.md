# Temporary failure project

This is an example where [SBT revolver](https://github.com/spray/sbt-revolver/issues/51) fails. It does not aim at decreasing the value of the wonderful work the team made, it's just a test case to later fix.

# How to run

    sbt
    
    >run
    
    The file is:
    (file:/.../.ivy2/cache/org.scala-lang/scala-library/jars/scala-libra
ry-2.11.7.jar <no signer certificates>)

# Where Revolver fails:

    >re-start
    
    The file is:
    null
